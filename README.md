A shared repo for the SENG 350 project
## Directory Information:
- The configuration file that loads up OUR app is www.js (bin/www.js)

- Routes are built in the routes folder, and are implementations of the base route. See index.ts for how to create a new routes
- Static files likes images and stylesheets are in the 'public' folder
